### About This Project:

* A simple attempt to make a toy store review page with a navigatable navbar. In the Home section, a few example reviews are displayed which can be further explored by clicking on the 'See All Reviews' button or 'Reviews' in the navbar.
* The Dashboard section displays the monthly investment and sales (In Â£GPB) from March to August giving our viewers a rough idea about our capital. This was performed using Recharts (https://recharts.org/en-US/).
* The Blogs section answers some basic questions and their answers that we've learned so far. This is to refresh and recap some of the previously learned content. 
* And finally the About section tells a little about what we are and do. It also tells our customers what our values are, what really matters to us and how we want to contribute to the society.
